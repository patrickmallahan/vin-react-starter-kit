# VinSolutions JavaScript Starter Kit
This is a starter kit for building a new React project at VinSolutions. The goal: Make it easy to start a robust new client-side app using modern tooling:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for rich, fast, client-side components  
* [Babel](http://babeljs.io) for compiling ES6 to ES5, so we can enjoy the new version of JavaScript today  
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for bundling all JS including npm packages for use in the browser  
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) for automated tests with [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for assertions
* [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for code coverage data
* [TrackJS](http://trackjs.com) for JS error tracking in production  
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for linting JS  
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for styling  
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) glues all this together in a handy automated build

The starter kit includes a working example app that puts all of the above to use.

## Get Started
1. Clone the project from GitHub (or download the zip if you prefer). I suggest installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and using Git Bash for your command line work, but this will also work on the Window DOS command prompt)
2. `npm install` - This will install all the necessary packages (listed in package.json). 
3. `gulp` - This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser.

## Testing
Streamlined automated testing is a core feature of this starter kit. All tests are placed in files that end in .spec.js. They are placed in the same directory as the file under test. Why?
+ The existence of tests is highly visible
+ Easy to open since they're in the same folder as the file you're working with
+ Easy to create new test files when creating new source files
+ Short import paths are easy to type and less brittle
+ As files are moved, it's easy to move tests alongside  

## Debugging
When you run the default Gulp task by typing `gulp`, no JS is minified. For production, you'll want to minify the JS via `gulp build`. To enable easy debugging of minified JS, a sourcemap is generated by the `gulp build` task. This means your original JS source will be displayed in your browser's dev console. Note that different browsers display the original source differently. Chrome automatically shows the original source if a sourcemap is available. Safari, in contrast, will display the compiled source and you'll [have to cmd+click on a given line to be taken to the original source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19550060/how-do-i-toggle-source-mapping-in-safari-7).
